## Installation

This extension can be found in the [VS Code extension store](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rubendew.vsch-core).

You can also go to the [releases](https://github.com/githrdw/vsc-home/releases) to download and install the `.vsix` manually.<br/>
If you want to build this project from source, install [lerna-lite](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite) globally with NPM and use Yarn to install the workspace dependencies.

## How to add your own widget

You can start using the [vsch-template](https://github.com/githrdw/vsch-template):

1. Go to `%appdata%/vsc-home/widgets` (Windows)<br/>
Go to `/Users/<USER>/Library/Preferences/vsch-home/widgets` (MacOS)
2. Clone the template and name the directory `vsch_Demo`:

```
git clone git@github.com:githrdw/vsch-template.git vsch_Demo
```
> **Note**
<br/> Subdirectories in `vsch-home/widgets` MUST start with `vsch_` because of how Webpack works. 
3. Build and install the widget

```
cd vsch_Demo
yarn install
# or npm install
yarn build
# or npm build
```

4. Drag your new widget into the grid

All configurations are stored in AppData, feel free to have a look and customize!

## Technical details

The application consists of three modules; a sidebar, grid (both web views) and the core.

### Core

Causes the web views to be opened and handles requests to the VSCode api.
Also sets up an EventBus for the webviews, so they are able to communicate with each other.

Used techniques:
[VSCode API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api), Typescript, Webpack

### Grid

The most important element of this extension, namely providing a drag-n-drop grid on which widgets can be placed.

Used techniques:
[React](https://github.com/facebook/react),
[ChakraUI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui),
[React-grid-layout](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout),
Typescript,
Webpack
(with [module-federation](https://module-federation.github.io/blog/get-started) to dynamically load React components!)

### Sidebar

Sidebar with `Home` icon as shortcut / escape hatch to the dashboard itself.
Also contains a list of components to use that can be dragged to the grid

Used techniques: HTML, Sass, ES6, Rollup

## Todo

- Recent projects widget
  - Option to duplicate / transform to static collection widget
- Access to VS Code API from external widget
- Automate the custom React component creation flow
